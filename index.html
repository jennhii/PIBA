					<h2>Moving <span>Forward</span></h2>
						<p class="lines-10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the earliest goals for Office of Performance Improvement and Business Analytics (PIBA) was to engage with faculty and staff about different business operations and system functions at the University of Louisville. In our open forums and focus workgroups, UofL employees help us identify and respond effectively to the administrative challenges that units and departments face in their day-to-day responsibilities. In 12 workgroups covering different areas of focus, over 60 employees with more than a combined 1000 years of service have brought their unique perspectives on how to collaboratively address and transform business process improvements for the university. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employees have emphasized the expectation that, in today's technology-driven office environment, administrative tasks and routine business activities should be completed digitally. By establishing and utilizing new technologies, PIBA looks to improve the interrelated systems and business practices on which the institution runs while maximizing productivity, improving efficiency and strengthening customer service. We are grateful to everyone who provided their time, feedback and vision.</p>

					<h2>A Better <span>Workflow</span></h2>
						<p class="lines-10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our employees are one of UofL's most valuable assets and PIBA's workgroups identified several ways to use technology to improve resources for employees. One request was a paperless and workflow-enabled time-capture system. In the past, the recording of time and attendance for individuals on hourly schedules has varied depending on the unit or department and type of position. Paper-based methods of submission for approval and unit recordkeeping often created issues and, in some cases, did not align with best practices for payroll.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on feedback from our timekeeping workgroup, we've created a self-service portal and implemented a web-based, easy-to-use application that combines a time capture process and individual specific payroll calculations. The paperless process allows employees to record time worked and leave taken. The mobile-enabled system then provides timekeepers and supervisors a straightforward method of assuring accurate time is calculated and paid.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within two months time, we tested the application with 100 employees then widened testing to over 500 people, including employees from across 3 units. We implemented university-wide to over 5,000 employees at the end of November.</p>

					<h2>Self-Service <span>Options</span></h2>
						<p class="lines-10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PIBA works to increase automation and system functionality to provide seamless services and improved satisfaction within the UofL community. Like our other recent addition to online employee self-service tools, Preferred Name Options for Employees, the University's Staff Senate initiated the project on self-service direct deposit. This project will update the current paper-based system, extend the options for activating or changing an employee's payroll direct deposit and increase the selection possibilities for accounts. Furthermore, it will eliminate the requirement to submit a cancelled check for account verification.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An online, easy-to-use self-service process, UofL employees will be able to configure the direct deposit of their paychecks to one account, multiple accounts or even distributed to multiple institutions with the appropriate account information. Additionally, the amount deposited to different accounts or multiple institutions can be distributed in specific set amounts and/or percentages of the total paycheck. For security purposes, a red flag feature will allow employees to receive an email alert if their direct deposit settings are modified at any time.</p>

					<h2>Technology <span>Driven</span></h2>
					<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our travel and expense project grew out of a PIBA workgroup where both faculty and staff identified a need to update overall process for university-related travel. Along with the university's recent change of travel partners, the various methods for securing travel approval, arranging travel reservations and inconsistent procedures for reimbursement created confusion among individuals in most units and departments. The workgroup emphasized updating the system and procedures to accurately reflect the realities of travel in today's digital world. A goal of aligning people's methods of working, enterprise systems and university policies with a technology-driven solution was set.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The travel and expense project aims to generate a user-friendly, mobile-enabled system that will simplify the travel and reimbursement process. By leveraging a more streamlined workflow and synching with our travel partner's online systems, we hope to reduce the steps required of the traveler, supervisor/approver and business offices.</p>

					<h2>Stronger <span>Solutions</span></h2>
					<p class="lines-10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our first successful solution for UofL was to centralize and streamline the hiring (onboarding) of student assistants, graduate assistants and temporaries. Launched in August of 2016, our Business Operations Center and an online Business Operations portal eliminated the need for a redundantly populated 36-page hiring packet. The new paperless solution allows these new employees to complete their information from any computer, smartphone or enabled device and have multiple ways to access our one-stop customer service center.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To continue with the mandate on redefining hiring practices set by our focus workgroups, we are developing additional paperless personnel action processes. Next is an expansion of our onboarding system to target the hiring of Lecturers (L11 and L12 paygroups). In the future, the Business Operations portal will also feature other intuitive, efficient and seamless personnel actions such as employee hiring, compensation changes and role changes. As a multi-modal system, the user will be able to access their information from any device and be consistent across the university. Data within the system will auto-populate forms in order to facilitate a one-time entry of data or use of current enterprise system information.</p>
