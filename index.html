							<h2><span>Background</span></h2>
							<p>One of the earliest goals for Office of Performance Improvement and Business Analytics (PIBA) was to engage with faculty and staff in open informational forums and selected focus workgroups about different business operations and system functions at the University of Louisville. The purpose for these sessions and workgroups was to have UofL employees help us identify and respond effectively to the administrative challenges that units and departments face in their day-to-day responsibilities. In 12 workgroups covering different areas of focus, over 60 employees with more than a combined 1000 years of service have brought their unique perspectives on how to collaboratively address and transform business process improvements for the university.<br>In each discussion employees emphasized the expectation that, in today’s technology-driven office environment, administrative tasks and routine business activities should be completed digitally. By establishing and utilizing new technologies, PIBA looks to improve the interrelated systems and business practices on which the institution runs. And as we move forward with our various workgroups, we continue to address UofL’s need to maximize productivity, improve efficiency, strengthen customer service and create consistency across office units and within multiple system platforms. We are grateful to everyone who provided their time, feedback and vision.</p>

							<!-- <h2>Project <span>Two</span></h2> -->
							<p>Our employees are one of UofL’s most valuable assets and PIBA’s workgroups identified several ways to make their daily responsibilities easier via technology. In the past, the recording of time and attendance for individuals on hourly schedules has varied depending on the unit or department and type of position. Paper-based submissions for approval and unit recordkeeping often created issues and, in some cases, did not align with best practices for payroll. In order to improve consistency across the enterprise, university administrators, supervisors and employees requested a paperless and workflow-enabled system of timekeeping.<br>Based on feedback from our workgroup focused on the topic, individuals from PIBA and our Solutions Architect worked collaboratively to create a self-service dashboard and implement a web-based, easy-to-use hourly timesheet application that combines a time capture process and individual specific payroll calculations. The paperless process allows employees to record time worked and leave taken (holiday, sick or vacation). The mobile-enabled system then provides departmental timekeepers and supervisors a straightforward method of assuring accurate time is calculated and paid.<br>Within two months time, we began testing the application with 100 employees within some units under the Office of Finance and Administration. An extension of the assessment widened to over 500 people, including employees from the Provost’s Office and the College of Education and Human Development. We anticipate implementation university-wide to over 5,000 employees by the end of November.</p>

							<h2>Project <span>Three</span></h2>
							<p>PIBA works to increase automation and system functionality to provide seamless services and improved satisfaction within the UofL community. Like our other recent addition to online employee self-service tools, Preferred Name Options for Employees, the University’s Staff Senate initiated the project on self-service direct deposit. This project will update the current paper-based system, extend the options for activating or changing an employee’s payroll direct deposit and increase the selection possibilities for accounts. Furthermore, it will eliminate the requirement to submit a cancelled check for account verification.<br>An online, easy-to-use process, UofL employees will be able to configure the direct deposit of their paychecks to one account, multiple accounts or even distributed to multiple institutions with the appropriate account information. Additionally, the amount deposited to different accounts or multiple institutions can be distributed in specific set amounts and/or percentages of the total paycheck. For security purposes, a red flag feature is also part of this new system. Employees will receive an email alert if their direct deposit settings are modified at any time. This additional measure will allow users to confirm the change action as initiated by the employee.</p>

							<!-- <h2>Project <span>Four</span></h2> -->
							<p>Our travel and expense project grew out of one of the PIBA workgroups where both faculty and staff identified a need to update the recording and compensation procedures for university-related travel. Along with the university’s recent change of travel partners, the various methods for securing travel approval, arranging reservations and inconsistent procedures for reimbursement created confusion among individuals throughout UofL. The workgroup emphasized updating the system and procedures to accurately reflect the realities of travel in today’s digital world. A goal of aligning people’s methods of working, enterprise systems and university policies with a technology-driven solution was set.<br>The travel and expense project aims to generate a user-friendly, mobile-enabled system for gathering associated expenses and initiating the reimbursement procedure. Also, by leveraging a more streamlined and transparent workflow, the processing of information will be reduced for the traveler, supervisor/approver and business offices. Simplifying the nature of travel will eliminate redundancies and optimize the available resources for assistance in travel. Currently in testing, we look to improve submittal of receipts, synch with our travel partner’s online reservation systems and reduce the number of click-throughs for each user. Ultimately, the seamless service will allow the university community to travel with confidence and ease.</p>

							<h2>Project <span>Five</span></h2>
							<p>In PIBA, we work to solve the problems asked of us by implementing better technologically driven results. Our first successful solution for UofL was to centralize and streamline the hiring (onboarding) of student assistants, graduate assistants and temporaries. Launched in August of 2016, our Business Operations Center and an online Business Operations portal eliminated the need for a redundantly populated 36-page hiring packet. The new paperless solution allows these new employees to complete their information from any computer, smartphone or enabled device and have multiple ways to access our one-stop customer service center.<br>To continue with the mandate on redefining hiring practices set by our focus workgroups, we are developing additional paperless personnel action processes. Next is an expansion of our onboarding system to target the hiring of Lecturers (L11 and L12 paygroups). In the future, the Business Operations portal will feature other intuitive, efficient and seamless personnel actions such as employee hiring, compensation changes and role changes. As a multi-modal system, the user will be able to access their information from any device and be consistent across the university. Data within the system will auto-populate forms in order to facilitate a one-time entry of data or use of current enterprise system information.</p>
